# ___Asynchronous Messaging Workshop___

## Overview

The Asynchronous Messaging Workshop is a collection of individual labs covering different aspects and patterns of asynchronous messaging. You will use [Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) and [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) during the workshop extensively and we will use [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [AWS SAM](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) and the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) as well. Each lab can be done separately and there is no dependency between the rounds. Each lab takes between 15 - 30 minutes, depending which lab you are executing and whether you will use the AWS Console or AWS SAM.
